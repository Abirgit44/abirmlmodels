## Getting Started

To get started with these machine learning models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/Abirgit44/abirmlmodels.git```


2. Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You can create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages using `pip`:

>python -m venv venv
>source venv/bin/activate
>pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Explore the models and algorithms in the repository, and review their respective documentation for usage instructions.

## Usage

Each model or algorithm is organized in a separate directory within this repository. Inside each directory, you will typically find the following:

- Python scripts for training and testing the model.
- Jupyter notebooks for interactive examples and explanations.
- Data files or links to obtain the necessary datasets.
- Documentation on how to use the model and interpret the results.

You can run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to experiment with the models on your own data or use the provided sample datasets.
